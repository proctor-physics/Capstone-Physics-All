    "    1. Use `plt.scatter(....)` and include the arguments `s = 1` and `marker = \"o\"` to get the cleanest image\n",
    "    2. Additionally, add color! To do this, create an additional array of length N (I'll refer to this as `color_array`). The numbers in this array are up to you, but should not be all zero).\n",
    "    3. In your `plt.scatter(...)` call, add arguments `c = color_array` and `cmap = \"Greens\"`. Once this is working for you, you're welcome to look up and use other colormaps.\n",
