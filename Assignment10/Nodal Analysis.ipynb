    "One of the fundamental laws used in circuit analysis is Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL). This law is summarized as the total current entering the junction must be equal to the total current leaving a junction. Since current is the flow of charge (specifically, $I = \\frac{dQ}{dt}$), this law is a statement of conservation of charge. "
